          <h3 class="text-center">Welcome to Cat Rescue, a dedicated haven for cats in need. Our mission is to rescue,
            rehabilitate, and rehome stray, abandoned,
            and at-risk cats while promoting responsible pet ownership and feline welfare.

            Founded in 2000, our shelter has been a safe space for countless cats, providing them with medical care,
            socialization, and love until they find their forever homes.
            We believe every cat deserves a second chance, whether they are kittens, seniors, or those with special
            needs.

            Beyond adoptions, we advocate for community awareness through trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs, educational
            workshops, and volunteer opportunities. Our dedicated team of staff
            and volunteers work tirelessly to ensure that every cat receives the care and compassion they deserve.

            At Cat Rescue, we believe that love is best measured in purrs. Whether you’re looking to adopt, foster,
            volunteer, or donate, we welcome you to join our mission and make a
            difference in the lives of cats.

          The Story of Narelle Caris: A Lifelong Mission to Save Cats

          <h3> Narelle Caris never planned on starting a cat rescue, but fate—and a tiny, abandoned kitten—had other
            ideas. Growing up, Narelle Caris always had a deep love for animals,
            but it wasn’t until a stormy night many years ago that their true calling became clear.
            <h3>One evening, as thunder roared outside, Narelle Caris heard faint cries coming from a nearby alley.
              Following the sound, they discovered a drenched and shivering kitten,
              barely clinging to life. Without hesitation, they scooped up the fragile creature, wrapped it in their
              jacket, and rushed home. They nursed the kitten—who they later named
              Lucky—back to health, and in doing so, realized how many other cats were out there, struggling to survive.
            </h3>
            <h3>From that moment on, Narelle Caris began rescuing stray and abandoned cats, working tirelessly to find
              them safe and loving homes. What started as a one-person effort soon
              grew into something much bigger. With the support of fellow animal lovers, volunteers, and the community,
              Narelle Caris officially founded Cat Rescue in 2000, turning their
              passion into a full-fledged rescue center.</h3>
            <h3>Today, Cat Rescue has saved hundreds—if not thousands—of feline lives. Under Narelle Caris’s leadership,
              the shelter provides medical care, rehabilitation, and adoption
              services, along with education and outreach programs to promote responsible pet ownership.</h3>
            <h3>Though the journey hasn’t always been easy, Narelle Caris remains driven by the same belief that started
              it all: every cat deserves a chance at love and a forever home.
              And it all began with Lucky—the little kitten who changed everything.</h3>
            <h3 class="text-center">🐾 "Rescue isn’t just what we do—it’s who we are." 🐾</h3>
